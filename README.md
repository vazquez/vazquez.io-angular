I'm slowly redesigning my website, one commit a day.

This website is being built using the following wonderful open-source software:

- Yeoman
- AngularJS
- Gulp
- Bower
- Less
- Bootstrap
- Angular UI Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Protractor

###### Gulp Tasks:

* `gulp` or `gulp build` to build an optimized version of your application in `/dist`
* `gulp serve` to launch a browser sync server on your source files
* `gulp serve:dist` to launch a server on your optimized application
* `gulp wiredep` to fill bower dependencies in your `.html` file(s)
* `gulp test` to launch your unit tests with Karma
* `gulp test:auto` to launch your unit tests with Karma in watch mode
* `gulp protractor` to launch your e2e tests with Protractor
* `gulp protractor:dist` to launch your e2e tests with Protractor on the dist files
